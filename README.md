# Operating Systems CO2017
## About
The objective of this assignment is the simulation of major components in a simple operating system,
for example, scheduler, synchronization, related operations of physical memory and virtual memory.

## Description
In detail, student will practice with three major modules: scheduler, synchronization, mechanism
of memory allocation from virtual-to-physical memory.
- scheduler
- synchronization
- the operations of mem-allocation from virtual-to-physical

**Note**: All of the source codes are in ```src``` and their header file are in ```include```. Checking system is conducted by using ```input``` and ```ouput```.

## Result
After this assignment, student can understand partly the principle of a simple OS. They can draw
the role and meaning of key modules in the OS as well as how it works.
